# Pulumi Fundamentals

For this workshop, we're going to learn more about cloud computing by exploring how to use Pulumi to build, configure, and deploy your serverless application in Google Cloud using Python. 


We will create a storage bucket, an iam binding, a bucket object,  and a cloudfunction. Along the way, we'll learn more about how Pulumi works.

## Goals

* Build your first infrastructure with Pulumi
* Learn fundamental Infrastructure as Code concepts
* Learn fundamental Pulumi concepts
* Build a serverless function in Google

## Equipment, Tools, and Knowledge

You will need the following tools to complete this workshop:
