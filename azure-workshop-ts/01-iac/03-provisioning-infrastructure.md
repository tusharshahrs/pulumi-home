# Provisioning Infrastructure

Now that you have a project configured to use Azure, you'll create some basic infrastructure in it. We will start with a Resource Group.

## Step 1 &mdash; Declare a New Resource Group

Add the following to your `index.ts` file:

```ts
const resourceGroup = new resources.ResourceGroup("myresourcegroup", {
});
```

Feel free to choose any Azure region that supports the services used in these labs ([see this infographic](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/) for a list of available regions).

Note that we skipped naming the resource.  This is because we are going to have our resources use [Auto-Naming](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/resources/#autonaming). The main reason for this is that it allows
allows Pulumi to do zero-downtime resource updates.

> :white_check_mark: After this change, your `index.ts` should [look like this](./code/03/index.ts).

## Step 2 &mdash; Preview Your Changes

Now preview your changes:

```
pulumi up
```

This command evaluates your program, determines the resource updates to make, and shows you an outline of these changes:

```
Previewing update (dev):

     Type                                             Name              Plan
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack                              iac-workshop-dev  create
 +   └─ azure-nextgen:resources/latest:ResourceGroup  my-group          create

Resources:
    + 2 to create

Do you want to perform this update?
  yes
> no
  details
```

This is a summary view. Select `details` to view the full set of properties:

```
+ pulumi:pulumi:Stack: (create)
    [urn=urn:pulumi:dev::iac-workshop::pulumi:pulumi:Stack::iac-workshop-dev]
    + azure-nextgen:resources/latest:ResourceGroup: (create)
        [urn=urn:pulumi:dev::iac-workshop::azure-nextgen:resources/latest:ResourceGroup::my-group]
        [provider=urn:pulumi:dev::iac-workshop::pulumi:providers:azure-nextgen::default_0_2_3::04da6b54-80e4-46f7-96ec-b56ff0331ba9]
        location         : "westus"
        resourceGroupName: "my-group"

Do you want to perform this update?
  yes
> no
  details
```

The stack resource is a synthetic resource that all resources your program creates are parented to.

## Step 3 &mdash; Deploy Your Changes

Now that we've seen the full set of changes, let's deploy them. Select `yes`:

```
Updating (dev):

     Type                                             Name              Status
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack                              iac-workshop-dev  created
 +   └─ azure-nextgen:resources/latest:ResourceGroup  my-group          created

Resources:
    + 2 created

Duration: 8s

Permalink: https://app.pulumi.com/myuser/iac-workshop/dev/updates/1
```

Now your resource group has been created in your Azure account. Feel free to click the Permalink URL and explore; this will take you to the [Pulumi Console](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/console/), which records your deployment history.
